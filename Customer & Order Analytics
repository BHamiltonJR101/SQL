#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

-- Query #1
--How many orders were placed in January?
--Remember to filter out the blank and incorrect order IDs like we did in the "dealing with messy data" section of the previous lesson!

SELECT COUNT(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--Query #2
--How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
Select COUNT(Product)
From JanSales
Where Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
or orderid <> 'Order ID';

--Query #3
--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--Question #4
--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, min(price)
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product;

--Question #5
--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
--(Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT Sum(Quantity)*price AS Revenue, Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
Where length (orderid) = 6
And orderid<> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY Product;

--Question #6
--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT 
Product,
SUM(Quantity),
SUM(Quantity)*price AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

--Question #7
--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT
count(distinct cust.acctnum) AS acct,
avg(quantity*price)AS AVGspent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
