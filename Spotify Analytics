# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

--Question 1) What are the top 10 songs

SELECT *
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
 ORDER BY popularity DESC
 LIMIT 10;
 
-- Question 2) How many songs are High tempo(120-140 BPM), Moderate Tempo(81-119 BPM), or low Tempo(60-80 BPM)

SELECT 
Count(*) AS Tracks,
 
 CASE WHEN tempo > 120 
 THEN "HIGH"
  
 WHEN tempo > 81 
 THEN "MOD"
  
  ELSE "LOW" 
  END AS HML
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
 Group BY HML;
 
--Question 3) What Artist has the most songs in the top 50
SElect Count(*) As Songs,
